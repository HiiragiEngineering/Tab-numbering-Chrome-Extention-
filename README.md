# Tab-numbering-Chrome-Extention-

Shortcut key for switching between tabs in Chrome for Mac.
⌘ + [1..8] — navigate to a tab # (count from the left)

This extension shows tab number and helps you use these shortcuts.

Download "tabnumbering" folder. Access "chrome://extensions/" and enable "developer mode." Then clicking "load unpacked" , load the folder you've downloaded.

This is a extention for Google Chrome. It works also in Brave (or other Chromium browsers.)  


Additionaly, You cannot use them for more than 9 tabs, so when you are opening 10th tab, this extension has a function to open it as a "new window." This function is now suspended(comment outed). If you need this, rewrite the source code by your self, please.
