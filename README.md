# Tab-numbering-Chrome-Extention-

Shortcut key for switching between tabs in Chrome for Mac.
⌘ + [1..8] — navigate to a tab # (count from the left)

This extension shows tab number and helps you use these shortcuts.
You cannot use them for more than 9 tabs, so when you are opening 10th tab, this extension opens it as a "new window." 

Download "tabnumbering" folder. Access chrome://extensions/ and turn on "developper mode." Then clicking "load unpacked" , load the folder you've downloaded.

This is a extention for Google Chrome. It works also in Brave (or other Chromium browsers.)
